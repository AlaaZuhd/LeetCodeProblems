# Median of Two Sorted Arrays

## Problem Description: 
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.
The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

## Problem Constraints:
* nums1.length == m
* nums2.length == n
* 0 <= m <= 1000
* 0 <= n <= 1000
* 1 <= m + n <= 2000
* -10<sup>6</sup> <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10<sup>6</sup>
