# Count Items Matching a Rule

## Problem Description: 
You are given an array items, where each items[i] = [typei, colori, namei] describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, ruleKey and ruleValue.
The ith item is said to match the rule if one of the following is true:
ruleKey == "type" and ruleValue == typei.
ruleKey == "color" and ruleValue == colori.
ruleKey == "name" and ruleValue == namei.
Return the number of items that match the given rule.

 
## Problem Constraints:
* 1 <= items.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
* 1 <= typei.length, colori.length, namei.length, ruleValue.length <= 10
* ruleKey is equal to either "type", "color", or "name".
* All strings consist only of lowercase letters.
